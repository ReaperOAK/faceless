**Planning social media workflow**

The user wants a workflow for social media, covering steps like "research topics," "plan content," "generate content," and "post content." This isn’t overly complex, but it will definitely require research. I'll search for information using the web tool to collect citations from useful sources like HubSpot, Buffer, and Sprout Social. I'll look up "social media content workflow research topics plan content generate content post content" and gather diverse citations. After gathering data, I’ll present the workflow with the required citations.


**Creating content workflow**

The user requested a structured workflow for social media, touching on research, planning, content creation, and posting. To make it solid, I'll need to gather high-quality citations. I'll search for relevant articles using trusted sources like HubSpot, Buffer, and Sprout Social. Afterward, I'll summarize the workflow and ensure each sentence is backed by diverse citations, as required. I'll work on crafting the workflow and plan the necessary search queries. Time to gather and document the right references.

Below is a concise, eight‑step automated content workflow you can implement in your dashboard. Each step builds on the previous, ensuring you move methodically from ideation through publishing and analysis without overwhelm.

A robust workflow consists of sequential phases that guide you from initial topic research to performance analysis and iterative improvement — all of which you can orchestrate within your custom web app dashboard . ([SocialBee][1]) A well‑defined roadmap ensures clarity around roles, tools, and timelines, reducing friction and accelerating execution . ([Sprout Social][2]) Automating each phase lets you maintain consistent output while freeing up your time for strategic growth . ([Planable][3]) By tracking metrics at every stage, you can iteratively refine prompts, posting schedules, and content formats for ever‑better ROI . ([Sprinklr][4])

## 1. Research & Topic Discovery

* **Conduct keyword and trend analysis:** Use Google Trends or Keyword Surfer to identify high‑interest topics in your niche. ([SocialBee][1])
* **Curate content ideas:** Pull related questions from “Answer The Public” or competitor analyses via SocialBee’s content ideas document. ([SocialBee][1])

## 2. Content Planning & Calendar Setup

* **Define content pillars and formats:** Establish 3–5 core themes (e.g., tips, tutorials, case studies) and map them to post types (image, video, thread). ([Social Media Dashboard][5])
* **Build a content calendar widget:** In your dashboard, display planned topics, statuses (Idea → Draft → Scheduled), and publish dates. ([Sprout Social][2])

## 3. Content Generation

* **Automate drafts with AI:** Integrate an AI writing API (e.g., Copy.ai free tier or self‑hosted GPT‑Neo) to generate captions, scripts, and article outlines. ([Planable][3])
* **Embed multimedia creation tools:** Connect to Lumen5 or InVideo for automated video assembly from your AI scripts. ([Loomly][6])

## 4. Review & Approval

* **In‑dashboard proofreading:** Add a “Review” status where you or a collaborator can edit drafts directly, using integrated spell‑check and style linting. ([LinkedIn][7])
* **Track version history:** Store each revision in SQLite or JSON, with timestamped audit logs for easy rollback. ([Planable][3])

## 5. Scheduling Automation

* **Queue posts via free tools:** Push approved drafts to Buffer’s free plan (3 channels, 10 posts/channel) using its API. ([SocialBee][1], [Reddit][8])
* **Custom scheduling interface:** Let users pick dates/times in the dashboard and trigger Buffer (or n8n/IFTTT) workflows accordingly. ([Planable][3])

## 6. Publishing & Engagement

* **Monitor publish status:** Use webhook callbacks from social APIs to confirm live posting. ([celum.com][9])
* **Automate basic replies:** Integrate ManyChat or Tidio chatbots to handle comments/DMs and funnel leads to affiliate links. ([Loomly][6])

## 7. Performance Monitoring

* **API‑driven metrics dashboard:** Pull engagement data (views, likes, shares) from platform insights and display in real time. ([Sprinklr][4])
* **Alerting system:** Configure email or Slack notifications for significant dips or spikes in KPIs via webhook integrations. ([Sprout Social][2])

## 8. Analysis & Iteration

* **Weekly and monthly reports:** Generate automated reports summarizing top‑performing posts, engagement rates, and growth trends. ([Assembly | Social Media Management Tool][10])
* **Iterative prompt tuning:** Adjust AI prompts, posting times, and content formats based on performance insights to optimize ROI over time. ([Planable][3])

By following these eight clear phases—each fully codable and automatable—you’ll transform a daunting “post‑daily” regimen into a scalable, low‑touch system. Implement each module in your custom dashboard one at a time, verify its stability, then move on to the next, ensuring steady progress without overwhelm.
