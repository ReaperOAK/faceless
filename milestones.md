**Creating a structured plan for a dashboard web app**

The user wants a step-by-step plan with milestones for building a dashboard web app using free options or coding it themselves. I’m considering tools for social media scheduling, AI content generation, and web hosting that are free. My first steps: 1) Choose the niche and research using Google Trends, 2) Set up a dashboard prototype with Retool or custom Node.js, and 3) Automate content generation with openAI free options or local models like Hugging Face. I’ll search for open-source frameworks and recommend some good options.

**Planning free tools and automation**

I'm considering using free services like Buffer (for scheduling), Google Analytics (for metrics), and affiliate marketing (for monetization). I'll need citations for everything, so I'm going to look up specific details about the Buffer free plan, Retool's open-source dashboard, and alternatives to services like Zapier. I'll start by searching for information on those topics like "Buffer free forever plan details" and "open source dashboard frameworks" for legitimate references. Let's perform these searches to gather the details!


**Planning project milestones**

For the project, I’m thinking of setting clear milestones. Phase 1 consists of research and setup, over Weeks 1–2. The first milestone is selecting and validating a niche, using Google Trends as the tool. I’ll start by narrowing it down to the top three niches. I also need to automate scheduling with free tools like Buffer and native APIs and set up Google Analytics for metrics. I’ll search for relevant information on these tools as well. Let’s kick off the research!


Thought for 9 seconds


Below is a lean, 12‑week roadmap broken into bite‑sized phases so you can build a zero‑cost, fully automated social‑media + website system—and roll it into a single custom dashboard web app. Each phase has clear milestones, free‑forever or open‑source tools you can code against, and exact weeks to keep momentum without overwhelm.

Each phase builds on the last:

1. **Research & Niche Validation** (Weeks 1–2)
2. **Dashboard MVP Setup** (Weeks 3–4)
3. **AI Content Pipeline** (Weeks 5–6)
4. **Post Scheduling Automation** (Weeks 7–8)
5. **Metrics & Monitoring** (Weeks 9–10)
6. **Monetization Integration** (Weeks 11–12)
7. **Scale & Iterate** (Month 4+)

**By following these weekly milestones, you’ll steadily build—even code—an end‑to‑end automated ecosystem that requires no up‑front spend. Each phase feeds directly into your custom dashboard, so you stay focused, avoid overwhelm, and can scale profitably entirely on free or open‑source platforms.**
