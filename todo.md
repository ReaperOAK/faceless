**Building an MVP for Instagram automation**

The user wants an MVP that auto-creates content for Instagram and posts it. I'll start by researching the necessary technologies and tools, like the Instagram Graph API for automated posting (which requires a Facebook developer app and a business account). I'll also check Python libraries for interacting with Instagram and explore free options for both content generation and posting. There are some complexities to address, so I'll gather resources and include references on tools and APIs to help build this out.

**Exploring Instagram publishing options**

To schedule posts for Instagram Business profiles, you could use official methods like the Graph API (requires approval and a token). For a DIY approach, you could consider tools such as Selenium, InstaPy, or Instabot, though they carry a risk of account violation. For a simple solution, using a Python-based app with Django or Flask could be effective. I'll look up more details by searching for terms like "Instagram Graph API Python post image" and see what comes up.

- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

Thought for 6 seconds

Below is an end‑to‑end MVP workflow and architecture for a simple Python‑based application that (1) generates Instagram content automatically and (2) publishes it via the official Instagram Graph API. You’ll use only free‑forever or open‑source components—no paid services required.

1. **Content Generation**

   1. Use a self‑hosted NLP model (e.g., GPT‑Neo via Hugging Face) or the free tier of an AI writing service to generate captions and post ideas.
   2. Optionally, render those captions onto images using Python’s Pillow library or a headless browser approach (e.g., Playwright) to create visual posts.

2. **Media Hosting (Public URLs)**
   Instagram Graph API mandates that media files be accessible via public URLs. For MVP, you can:

   * Spin up a free ngrok tunnel to expose a local folder over HTTP ([Stack Overflow][1]).
   * Or use Filestack’s free tier to host images and get public URLs ([GitHub][2]).

3. **Instagram Publishing via Graph API**

   1. Convert your Instagram personal account into a Business or Creator account and link it to a Facebook Page ([Tati Digital Connect][3]).
   2. Create a Facebook Developer App, grant it `instagram_content_publish` and related permissions, and generate a long‑lived access token ([Tati Digital Connect][3]).
   3. Use the two‑step container + publish flow:

      * **Container creation**: POST to `/{ig_user_id}/media` with `image_url` and `caption` to receive a `creation_id` ([Facebook for Developers][4]).
      * **Publish**: POST to `/{ig_user_id}/media_publish` with the `creation_id` to finalize the post ([Facebook for Developers][4]).

4. **Application Skeleton**

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request
   import requests
   # (Plus your AI-gen and media-hosting imports)

   APP = Flask(__name__)
   IG_UL = "https://graph.facebook.com/v15.0"
   ACCESS_TOKEN = "<YOUR_LONG_LIVED_TOKEN>"
   IG_USER_ID = "<YOUR_IG_BUSINESS_ID>"

   def create_media_container(image_url: str, caption: str) -> str:
       """Step 1: Create a media container and return its creation_id."""
       url = f"{IG_UL}/{IG_USER_ID}/media"
       params = {
           "image_url": image_url,
           "caption": caption,
           "access_token": ACCESS_TOKEN
       }
       resp = requests.post(url, params=params).json()
       return resp["id"]

   def publish_media(creation_id: str) -> dict:
       """Step 2: Publish the container to Instagram."""
       url = f"{IG_UL}/{IG_USER_ID}/media_publish"
       params = {
           "creation_id": creation_id,
           "access_token": ACCESS_TOKEN
       }
       return requests.post(url, params=params).json()

   @APP.route("/auto_post", methods=["POST"])
   def auto_post():
       # 1. Generate caption via your AI module
       caption = generate_ai_caption()  
       # 2. Generate or select an image and get its public URL
       image_url = host_image_and_get_url()  
       # 3. Create & publish
       cid = create_media_container(image_url, caption)
       result = publish_media(cid)
       return result, 200

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       APP.run(port=5000)
   ```

   * This Flask app defines a single `/auto_post` endpoint that you can trigger (e.g., via cron or GitHub Actions) to generate and post new content daily.

5. **Detailed Setup Steps**

   * **Switch to Business Account:** In Instagram: Profile → Settings → Account → Switch to Professional → Business/Creator ([Tati Digital Connect][3]).
   * **Link to Facebook Page:** In FB Page Settings → Instagram, connect your IG account ([Tati Digital Connect][3]).
   * **Create Dev App & Token:** On developers.facebook.com, create an App, add Instagram Basic Display + Content Publish permissions, and use the Graph API Explorer to get a short‑lived token, then exchange it for a 60‑day token via the OAuth endpoint ([Tati Digital Connect][3]).
   * **Host Your Media:**

     * **Ngrok Option:** `ngrok http 8000` to expose `http://<your_tunnel>.ngrok.io/images/` folder ([Stack Overflow][1]).
     * **Filestack Option:** Use their Python SDK to upload and retrieve public URLs (free tier) ([GitHub][2]).

6. **Key References**

   * Official IG Content Publishing Guide ([Facebook for Developers][4])
   * Sample Python Medium Tutorial ([Medium][5])
   * Community‐built `instagram_simple_post` on GitHub ([GitHub][2])
   * Step‑by‑step code walkthrough on Zatosh’s blog ([Tati Digital Connect][3])

By following this MVP plan, you’ll have a single Python service that handles AI content creation, media hosting, and automated Instagram posting—fully on free tiers or open‑source tools, ready to scale as you validate your niche.
